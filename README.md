<!-- Project name is a `<utility/tool/feature>` that allows `<insert_target_audience>` to do `<action/task_it_does>`. -->

The dynasim package simulates dynamic systems in the form:
```math
\mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{C}\dot{\mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{K}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{C}_n g_c(\mathbf{x}, \dot{\mathbf{x}}) + \mathbf{K}_n g_k(\mathbf{x}, \dot{\mathbf{x}}) = \mathbf{f}
```
where $\mathbf{\Xi}_n g_{\bullet}(\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}}) = \mathbf{C}_n g_c(\mathbf{x}, \dot{\mathbf{x}}) + \mathbf{K}_n g_k(\mathbf{x}, \dot{\mathbf{x}})$ represents the nonlinear system forces. For example, a 3DOF Duffing oscillator, connected at one end, would have representative nonlinear forces,
```math
\mathbf{K}_n g_n(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix}
    k_{n,1} & - k_{n,2} & 0 \\
    0 & k_{n,2} & -k_{n,3} \\
    0 & 0 & k_{n,3}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1^3 \\
    (x_2-x_1)^3 \\
    (x_3 - x_2)^3
\end{bmatrix}
```

```
## Using DynaSim

### Quickstart Guide

To use DynaSim, here is a quick start guide to generate a 5-DOF oscillating system with some cubic stiffness nonlinearities:

```
import numpy as np
import dynasim

# create required variables
n_dof = 5

# create a time vector of 2048 time points up to 120 seconds
nt = 2048
time_span = np.linspace(0, 120, nt)

# create vectors of system parameters for sequential MDOF
m_vec = 10.0 * np.ones(n_dof)
c_vec = 1.0 * np.ones(n_dof)
k_vec = 15.0 * np.ones(n_dof)
# imposes every other connection as having an additional cubic stiffness
kn_vec = np.array([25.0 * (i%2) for i in range(n_dof)])

# create nonlinearities
system_nonlin = dynasim.nonlinearities.exponent_stiffness(kn_vec, exponent=3, dofs=n_dof)
# instantiate system and embed nonlinearity
system = dynasim.systems.mdof_cantilever(m_vec, c_vec, k_vec, dofs=n_dof, nonlinearity=system_nonlin)

# create excitations and embed to system
system.excitations = [None] * n_dof
system.excitations[-1] = dynasim.actuators.sine_sweep(w_l = 0.5, w_u = 2.0, F0 = 1.0)

# simulate system
data = system.simulate(time_span, z0=None)
```

### Nonlinearities

Three nonlinearities are available, exponent stiffness, exponent damping, and Van der Pol damping

```
dynasim.nonlinearities.exponent_stiffness(kn_vec, exponent=3, dofs=n_dof)
dynasim.nonlinearities.exponent_damping(cn_vec, exponent=0.5, dofs=n_dof)
dynasim.nonlinearities.vanDerPol(cn_vec, dofs=n_dof)
```
These classes contain the $g_k(\mathbf{x}, \dot{\mathbf{x}})$ function.

### Common system classes

There are a currently two system types available for MDOF systems, which are instantiated from vectors of system parameter values:

```
dynasim.systems.mdof_symmetric(m_, c_, k_, dofs, nonlinearity)
dynasim.systems.mdof_cantilever(m_, c_, k_, dofs, nonlinearity)
```

### Actuator classes

The forcing for the system should be a list of actuations, equal in length to the number of DOFs of the system, there many actuation types,
```
dynasim.actuators.sinusoid(...)
dynasim.actuators.white_gaussian(...)
dynasim.actuators.sine_sweep(...)
dynasim.actuators.rand_phase_ms(...)
dynasim.actuators.banded_noise(...)
```

### Totally custom system

One can generate a custom system by instantiating an MDOF system with corresponding modal matrices, but the nonlinearity must also be instantiated and 
```
dynasim.base.mdof_system(M, C, K, Cn, Kn)
```

## Continuous Beams

These work much like the MDOF systems but with a few tweaks. Where ```beam_kwargs_cmb``` is a dictionary of combined properties of the beam.
```
beam_kwargs_cmb = {
    "EI" : EI,  # Young's Modulus multiplied by second moment of intertia
    "pA" : pA,  # density multiplied by cross sectional area
    "c" : c,  # damping
    "l" : l  # length of beam
}
ss_beam = dynasim.systems.cont_beam("cmb_vars", **beam_kwargs_cmb)
```

One can then generate and retrieve the mode shapes of the beam via
```
xx, phis = ss_beam.gen_modes(support, n_modes, nx)
```
Where ```support``` is a string representing different support types for the beam, options available are:
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ss-ss` | Simply supported at both ends |
| `fx-fx` | Fixed at both ends |
| `fr-fr` | Free at both ends |
| `fx-ss` | Fixed at one end and simply supported at the other |
| `fx-fr` | Fixed at one end and free at the other |

Then, excitations are added as a list of dictionaries containing the location (in m) and excitation (prescribed as with mdof systems)
```
ss_beam.excitations = [
    {
        "excitation" : dynasim.actuators.sinusoid(1.2, 1.0),
        "loc" : 0.25
    }
]
```
Then simulate just as with the MDOF system, however, the returned data here is the modal coordinates, and so to retrieve displacement, simply multiply by, and sum through, the mode shapes.
```
data = ss_beam.simulate(tt, z0 = tau0)

ww = np.sum(np.matmul(data['x'][:,:,np.newaxis], phis.T[:,np.newaxis,:]), axis=0)
wwd = np.sum(np.matmul(data['xdot'][:,:,np.newaxis], phis.T[:,np.newaxis,:]), axis=0)
```
